# Machine learning models for image generation and the key points detection

*The whole projects can be split into two parts: keypoints detection and image generation
*Predicting 18 points in test images and silhouette images in test keypoints
*Both using machine learning models 
*Even though neural network may get a better effect
*Classification and regression models must be distinguished in both models
